# vaapi-tegra-driver

A VAAPI backend driver for NVIDIA Tegra SoC's, based on multimedia units accessed through Host1x.
This driver is experimental, don't expect it to work in every situation.

Currently supported features:

- NV12 to RGB colorspace conversion
- MPEG2 decoding
- H264 decoding (very experimental, known issues)
- X11/DRI2 surface presentation

Currently supported SoC's:

- Tegra210
- Tegra186
- Tegra194

## Requirements

- C++14-capable compiler
- libva headers
- libdrm headers
- Kernel with VIC driver and CONFIG_DRM_TEGRA_STAGING=y

## Building and testing

Building:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Testing:

```
export LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=<build directory>
export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=tegra

mpv --hwdec=vaapi-copy --hwdec-codecs=all video.m2v
```
